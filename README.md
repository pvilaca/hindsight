This repository contains all the code and data for the results in this manuscript:

Zachary A. King, Edward J. O'Brien, Adam M. Feist, Bernhard O. Palsson. Literature mining supports a next-generation modeling approach to predict cellular byproduct secretion. bioRxiv 066944; doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/066944

Currently, two dependencies for the code are not public. These are the Python packages `minime` and `ecolime`. When these are released, I will update `hindsight` with details on running them.

The `theseus` package is required. You can find it here:
