                 requires additional reducing power (NADH and/or NADPH) output
                 from glucose catabolism. Previously, with an anaerobically
                 expressed pyruvate dehydrogenase operon (aceEF-lpd), we
                 doubled the reducing power output to four NADH per glucose (or
                 1.2 xylose) catabolized anaerobically, which satisfied the
                 NADH requirement to establish a non-transgenic homoethanol
                 pathway (1 glucose or 1.2 xylose --> 2 acetyl-CoA + 4 NADH -->

                 was further engineered for reduction of xylose to xylitol by
                 (1) deleting the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adhE) to divert
                 NADH from the ethanol pathway; (2) deleting the
                 glucose-specific PTS permease gene (ptsG) to eliminate
                 catabolite repression and allow simultaneous uptake of glucose
                 and xylose; (3) cloning the aldose reductase gene (xylI) of
                 Candida boidinii to reduce xylose to xylitol. The resulting
                 strain, E. coli AI05 (pAGI02), could in theory simultaneously
                 uptake glucose and xylose, and utilize glucose as a source of
                 reducing power for the reduction of xylose to xylitol, with an
                 expected yield of four xylitol for each glucose consumed (YRPG
                 = 4) under anaerobic conditions. In resting cell fermentation
                 tests using glucose and xylose mixtures, E. coli AI05 (pAGI02)

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Anaerobic rather than aerobic fermentation is
                 preferred for conversion of biomass derived sugars to high
                 value redox-neutral and reduced commodities. This will likely
                 result in a higher yield of substrate to product conversion
                 and decrease production cost since substrate often accounts
                 for a significant portion of the overall cost. To this goal,
                 metabolic pathway engineering has been used to optimize
                 substrate carbon flow to target products. This approach works
                 well for the production of redox neutral products such as
                 lactic acid from redox neutral sugars using the reducing power
                 NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced) generated
                 from glycolysis (2 NADH per glucose equivalent). Nevertheless,
                 greater than two NADH per glucose catabolized is needed for
                 the production of reduced products (such as xylitol) from
                 redox neutral sugars by anaerobic fermentation. RESULTS: The
                 Escherichia coli strain AI05 ($\Delta$frdBC $\Delta$ldhA
                 $\Delta$ackA $\Delta$(focA-pflB) $\Delta$adhE $\Delta$ptsG
                 $\Delta$pdhR::pflBp 6-(aceEF-lpd)), previously engineered for
                 reduction of xylose to xylitol using reducing power (NADH
                 equivalent) of glucose catabolism, was further engineered by
                 1) deleting xylAB operon (encoding for xylose isomerase and
                 xylulokinase) to prevent xylose from entering the pentose
                 phosphate pathway; 2) anaerobically expressing the
                 sdhCDAB-sucABCD operon (encoding for succinate dehydrogenase,
                 $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA
                 synthetase) to enable an anaerobically functional
                 tricarboxcylic acid cycle with a theoretical 10 NAD(P)H
                 equivalent per glucose catabolized. These reducing equivalents
                 can be oxidized by synthetic respiration via xylose reduction,
                 producing xylitol. The resulting strain, AI21 (pAI02),
                 achieved a 96 \% xylose to xylitol conversion, with a yield of
                 6 xylitol per glucose catabolized (molar yield of xylitol per
                 glucose consumed (YRPG) = 6). This represents a 33 \%
                 improvement in xylose to xylitol conversion, and a 63 \%
                 increase in xylitol yield per glucose catabolized over that
                 achieved by AI05 (pAI02). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing reducing
                 power (NADH equivalent) output per glucose catabolized was
                 achieved by anaerobic expression of both the pdh operon
                 (pyruvate dehydrogenase) and the sdhCDAB-sucABCD operon,
                 resulting in a strain capable of generating 10 NADH equivalent
                 per glucose under anaerobic condition. The new E. coli strain
                 AI21 (pAI02) achieved an actual 96 \% conversion of xylose to
                 xylitol (via synthetic respiration), and 6 xylitol (from
                 xylose) per glucose catabolized (YRPG = 6, the highest known
                 value). This strategy can be used to engineer microbial
                 strains for the production of other reduced products from
                 redox neutral sugars using glucose as a source of reducing
                 power.",

                 with environmental impact of their use have stimulated the
                 development of alternative methods for fuel and chemical
                 production from renewable resources. In this work, we present
                 a new approach to produce $\alpha$,$\beta$-unsaturated
                 carboxylic acids ($\alpha$,$\beta$-UCAs) using an engineered
                 reversal of the $\beta$-oxidation (r-BOX) cycle. To increase
                 the availability of both acyl-CoAs and enoyl-CoAs for
                 $\alpha$,$\beta$-UCA production, we use an engineered
                 Escherichia coli strain devoid of mixed-acid fermentation
                 pathways and known thioesterases. Core genes for r-BOX such as
                 thiolase, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase,
                 and enoyl-CoA reductase were chromosomally overexpressed under
                 the control of a cumate inducible phage promoter. Native E.
                 coli thioesterase YdiI was used as the cycle-terminating
                 enzyme, as it was found to have not only the ability to
                 convert trans-enoyl-CoAs to the corresponding
                 $\alpha$,$\beta$-UCAs, but also a very low catalytic
                 efficiency on acetyl-CoA, the primer and extender unit for the
                 r-BOX pathway. Coupling of r-BOX with YdiI led to crotonic
                 acid production at titers reaching 1.5g/L in flask cultures
                 and 3.2g/L in a controlled bioreactor. The engineered r-BOX
                 pathway was also used to achieve for the first time the
                 production of 2-hexenoic acid, 2-octenoic acid, and 2-decenoic
                 acid at a final titer of 0.2g/L. The superior nature of the
                 engineered pathway was further validated through the use of in
                 silico metabolic flux analysis, which showed the ability of
                 r-BOX to support growth-coupled production of
                 $\alpha$,$\beta$-UCAs with a higher ATP efficiency than the
                 widely used fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Taken together,
                 our findings suggest that r-BOX could be an ideal platform to
                 implement the biological production of $\alpha$,$\beta$-UCAs.",

              thiolase, hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, crotonase and
              trans-enoyl-CoA reductase from a synthetic operon allowed the
              production of butyrate, hexanoate and octanoate. Elimination of
              native fermentation pathways by genetic deletion ($\Delta$ldhA,
              $\Delta$adhE, $\Delta$ackA, $\Delta$pta, $\Delta$frdC) helped
              eliminate undesired by-products and increase product yields.
              Initial butyrate production rates were high (0.7 g l(-1) h(-1))
              but quickly levelled off and further study suggested this was due
              to product toxicity and/or acidification of the growth medium.
              Results also showed that endogenous thioesterases significantly
              influenced product formation. In particular, deletion of the yciA
              thioesterase gene substantially increased hexanoate production
              while decreasing the production of butyrate. E. coli was also
              engineered to co-produce enzymes for even-chain FA production
              (described above) together with a coenzyme B12-dependent pathway
              for the production of propionyl-CoA, which allowed the production
              of odd-chain FAs (pentanoate and heptanoate). The B12-dependent
              pathway used here has the potential to allow the production of
              odd-chain FAs from a single growth substrate (glucose) in a more
              energy-efficient manner than the prior methods.",

              -alanine as the primary fermentation product from sugars by
              replacing the native D: -lactate dehydrogenase of E. coli SZ194
              with alanine dehydrogenase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus.
              As a result, the heterologous alanine dehydrogenase gene was
              integrated under the regulation of the native D: -lactate
              dehydrogenase (ldhA) promoter. This homologous promoter is
              growth-regulated and provides high levels of expression during
              anaerobic fermentation. Strain XZ111 accumulated alanine as the
              primary product during glucose fermentation. The methylglyoxal
              synthase gene (mgsA) was deleted to eliminate low levels of
              lactate and improve growth, and the catabolic alanine racemase
              gene (dadX) was deleted to minimize conversion of L: -alanine to
              D: -alanine. In these strains, reduced nicotinamide adenine
              dinucleotide oxidation during alanine biosynthesis is obligately
              linked to adenosine triphosphate production and cell growth. This
              linkage provided a basis for metabolic evolution where selection
              for improvements in growth coselected for increased glycolytic
              flux and alanine production. The resulting strain, XZ132,
              produced 1,279 mmol alanine from 120 g l(-1) glucose within 48 h
              during batch fermentation in the mineral salts medium. The
              alanine yield was 95\% on a weight basis (g g(-1) glucose) with a

              coli K12 MG1655 genome, resulting in the ECOM3 (E. coli
              cytochrome oxidase mutant) strain. Removal of cytochrome oxidases
              reduced the oxygen uptake rate of the knockout strain by nearly
              85\%. Moreover, the knockout strain was initially incapable of
              growing on M9 minimal medium. After the ECOM3 strain was
              subjected to adaptive evolution on glucose M9 medium for 60 days,
              a growth rate equivalent to that of anaerobic wild-type E. coli
              was achieved. Our findings demonstrate that three independently
              adaptively evolved ECOM3 populations acquired different
              phenotypes: one produced lactate as a sole fermentation product,
              while the other two strains exhibited a mixed-acid fermentation
              under oxic growth conditions with lactate remaining as the major
              product. The homofermenting strain showed a D-lactate yield of
              0.8 g/g from glucose. Gene expression and in silico model-based
              analyses were employed to identify perturbed pathways and explain
              phenotypic behavior. Significant upregulation of ygiN and sodAB
              explains the remaining oxygen uptake that was observed in evolved
              ECOM3 strains. E. coli strains produced in this study showed the
              ability to produce lactate as a fermentation product from glucose

              aerobic succinate production systems to increase their succinate
              yield and productivity. One of the aerobic succinate production
              systems developed earlier (Biotechnol, Bioeng., 2004, accepted)
              was constructed with five mutations (DeltasdhAB, Deltaicd,
              DeltaiclR, DeltapoxB, and Delta(ackA-pta)), which created a
              highly active glyoxylate cycle. In this study, a second

              mutations (DeltasdhAB, DeltaiclR, DeltapoxB, and
              Delta(ackA-pta)). This system has two routes in the aerobic

              cycle. Inactivation of ptsG and overexpression of a mutant

  abstract = "Fermentation enables the production of reduced metabolites, such
              as the biofuels ethanol and butanol, from fermentable sugars.
              This work demonstrates a general approach for designing and
              constructing a production host that uses a heterologous pathway
              as an obligately fermentative pathway to produce reduced
              metabolites, specifically, the biofuel isobutanol. Elementary
              mode analysis was applied to design an Escherichia coli strain
              optimized for isobutanol production under strictly anaerobic
              conditions. The central metabolism of E. coli was decomposed into
              38,219 functional, unique, and elementary modes (EMs). The model
              predictions revealed that during anaerobic growth E. coli cannot
              produce isobutanol as the sole fermentative product. By deleting
              7 chromosomal genes, the total 38,219 EMs were constrained to 12
              EMs, 6 of which can produce high yields of isobutanol in a range
              from 0.29 to 0.41 g isobutanol/g glucose under anaerobic
              conditions. The remaining 6 EMs rely primarily on the pyruvate
              dehydrogenase enzyme complex (PDHC) and are typically inhibited
              under anaerobic conditions. The redesigned E. coli strain was
              constrained to employ the anaerobic isobutanol pathways through
              deletion of 7 chromosomal genes, addition of 2 heterologous
              genes, and overexpression of 5 genes. Here we present the design,
              construction, and characterization of an isobutanol-producing E.
              coli strain to illustrate the approach. The model predictions are
              evaluated in relation to experimental data and strategies
              proposed to improve anaerobic isobutanol production. We also show
              that the endogenous alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase AdhE is the
              key enzyme responsible for the production of isobutanol and
              ethanol under anaerobic conditions. The glycolytic flux can be
              controlled to regulate the ratio of isobutanol to ethanol

              constructed a modified clostridial 1-butanol pathway in

              trans-enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase (Ter) and created NADH and

              other growth coupled papers: 22, 25, 38, 40, 42 ... but none of
              those were any good! Maybe a mistake.<br/><br/>Also points to
              these one: 8, 9, 26, 46, 48, and later 49, 29, 44. The good ones
              are 26, 46, 48, 44...basically the Lonnie Ingram
              papers<br/><br/>We reason that a significant driving force is
              necessary to achieve high-titer production, whereas driving
              forces are not as important in proof-of-concept production
              approaches. For 1-butanol, we define high titers as those greater
              than the toxicity level, which is about 10 g/liter (4). When
              examined in this light, driving forces can be found in almost all
              successful metabolic engineering strategies and may exist in
              several different forms, including (i) release of a gaseous
              molecule (e.g., CO2) which escapes out of the cell through
              diffusion and becomes diluted in the gas phase, (ii) irreversible
              reactions or polymer- ization (e.g., glycogen and
              polyhydroxyalkanoate), (iii) ATP draining by futile cycling (13,
              14, 33) or disruption of ATP synthase (12), (iv) transfer of
              electrons to an external sink (e.g., respiration and hydrogen
              production), or (v) product removal by phase separation.
              Therefore, metabolic engineering or synthetic biology strategies
              for high-titer production can be summarized and recast in two
              steps: (i) the creation of a driving force and (ii) coupling of
              the driving force to the desired pathway.``<br/><br/>''To
              demonstrate that the NADH surplus created in the host can be used
              as a selection pressure for optimizing the 1-butanol pathway, we
              subjected the three Ter homologues from T. vincentii, F.
              succinogenes, and F. johnsoniae to error- prone PCR mutagenesis
              followed by cotransformation with plasmid pEL11 into strain
              JCL166. Anaerobic growth was then examined on LB-glucose plates
              incubated at 37°C for the next 1 to 3 days. Potential positive
              mutants were isolated based on colony size, purified, sequenced,
              and confirmed to have 1-butanol production by retransformation
              with plasmid pEL11 into JCL166.``<br/><br/><br/>target:

  abstract = "Global energy and environmental problems have stimulated
              increased efforts towards synthesizing biofuels from renewable
              resources. Compared to the traditional biofuel, ethanol, higher
              alcohols offer advantages as gasoline substitutes because of
              their higher energy density and lower hygroscopicity. In
              addition, branched-chain alcohols have higher octane numbers
              compared with their straight-chain counterparts. However, these
              alcohols cannot be synthesized economically using native
              organisms. Here we present a metabolic engineering approach using
              Escherichia coli to produce higher alcohols including isobutanol,
              1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and
              2-phenylethanol from glucose, a renewable carbon source. This
              strategy uses the host's highly active amino acid biosynthetic
              pathway and diverts its 2-keto acid intermediates for alcohol
              synthesis. In particular, we have achieved high-yield,
              high-specificity production of isobutanol from glucose. The
              strategy enables the exploration of biofuels beyond those
              naturally accumulated to high quantities in microbial
              fermentation.",

  title    = "Novel pathway engineering design of the anaerobic central
              metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli to increase succinate yield

  abstract = "A novel in vivo method of producing succinate has been developed.
              A genetically engineered Escherichia coli strain has been
              constructed to meet the NADH requirement and carbon demand to
              produce high quantities and yield of succinate by strategically
              implementing metabolic pathway alterations. Currently, the
              maximum theoretical succinate yield under strictly anaerobic
              conditions through the fermentative succinate biosynthesis
              pathway is limited to one mole per mole of glucose due to NADH
              limitation. The implemented strategic design involves the
              construction of a dual succinate synthesis route, which diverts
              required quantities of NADH through the traditional fermentative
              pathway and maximizes the carbon converted to succinate by
              balancing the carbon flux through the fermentative pathway and
              the glyoxylate pathway (which has less NADH requirement). The
              synthesis of succinate uses a combination of the two pathways to
              balance the NADH. Consequently, experimental results indicated
              that these combined pathways gave the most efficient conversion
              of glucose to succinate with the highest yield using only 1.25
              moles of NADH per mole of succinate in contrast to the sole
              fermentative pathway, which uses 2 moles of NADH per mole of
              succinate. A recombinant E. coli strain, SBS550MG, was created by
              deactivating adhE, ldhA and ack-pta from the central metabolic
              pathway and by activating the glyoxylate pathway through the
              inactivation of iclR, which encodes a transcriptional repressor
              protein of the glyoxylate bypass. The inactivation of these genes
              in SBS550MG increased the succinate yield from glucose to about
              1.6 mol/mol with an average anaerobic productivity rate of 10
              mM/h (approximately 0.64 mM/h-OD600). This strain is capable of
              fermenting high concentrations of glucose in less than 24 h.
              Additional derepression of the glyxoylate pathway by inactivation
              of arcA, leading to a strain designated as SBS660MG, did not
              significantly increase the succinate yield and it decreased
              glucose consumption by 80\%. It was also observed that an adhE,
              ldhA and ack-pta mutant designated as SBS990MG, was able to
              achieve a high succinate yield similar to SBS550MG when
              expressing a Bacillus subtilis NADH-insensitive citrate synthase
              from a plasmid.",

               and biofuel production by microbial cell factories. However, it
               is difficult to achieve optimal redox rebalancing of synthetic
               pathways owing to the sensitive responses of cellular physiology
               according as the intracellular redox state changes. Here, we
               demonstrate optimal rebalancing of the intracellular redox state
               by model-driven control of expression using n-butanol production
               in Escherichia coli as a model system. The synthetic n-butanol
               production pathway was constructed by implementing synthetic
               constitutive promoters and designing synthetic 5'-untranslated
               regions (5'-UTR) for each gene. Redox rebalancing was achieved
               by anaerobically activating the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
               complex and additionally tuning the expression level of
               NAD(+)-dependent formate dehydrogenase (fdh1 from Saccharomyces
               cerevisiae) through rational UTR engineering. Interestingly,
               efficient production of n-butanol required different amounts of
               reducing equivalents depending on whether the substrate was
               glucose or galactose. One intriguing implication of this work is
               that additional strain improvement can be achieved, even within

  abstract = "Microbial processes for commodity chemicals have focused on
              reduced products and anaerobic conditions where substrate loss to
              cell mass and CO(2) are minimal and product yields are high. To
              facilitate expansion into more oxidized chemicals, Escherichia
              coli W3110 was genetically engineered for acetate production by
              using an approach that combines attributes of fermentative and
              oxidative metabolism (rapid growth, external electron acceptor)
              into a single biocatalyst. The resulting strain (TC36) converted
              333 mM glucose into 572 mM acetate, a product of equivalent
              oxidation state, in 18 h. With excess glucose, a maximum of 878
              mM acetate was produced. Strain TC36 was constructed by
              sequentially assembling deletions that inactivated oxidative
              phosphorylation (deltaatpFH), disrupted the cyclic function of
              the tricarboxylic acid pathway (deltasucA), and eliminated native
              fermentation pathways (deltafocA-pflB deltafrdBC deltaldhA
              deltaadhE). These mutations minimized the loss of substrate
              carbon and the oxygen requirement for redox balance. Although
              TC36 produces only four ATPs per glucose, this strain grows well
              in mineral salts medium and has no auxotrophic requirement.
              Glycolytic flux in TC36 (0.3 micromol.min(-1).mg(-1) protein) was
              twice that of the parent. Higher flux was attributed to a
              deletion of membrane-coupling subunits in (F(1)F(0))H(+)-ATP
              synthase that inactivated ATP synthesis while retaining
              cytoplasmic F(1)-ATPase activity. The effectiveness of this
              deletion in stimulating flux provides further evidence for the
              importance of ATP supply and demand in the regulation of central
              metabolism. Derivatives of TC36 may prove useful for the

              excess glucose. Glycolytic flux was >50\% faster for TC44
              producing pyruvate than for the wild-type W3110 during fully
              aerobic metabolism. The tolerance of E. coli to such drastic
              changes in metabolic flow and energy production implies
              considerable elasticity in permitted pool sizes for key metabolic
              intermediates such as pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. In strain TC44,
              pyruvate yield, pyruvate titer, and the rate of pyruvate
              production in mineral salts medium were equivalent or better than
              previously reported for other biocatalysts (yeast and bacteria)
              requiring complex vitamin feeding strategies and complex
              nutrients. TC44 offers the potential to improve the economics of
              pyruvate production by reducing the costs of materials, product
              purification, and waste disposal.",

  abstract = "Polylactic acid (PLA) is a promising biomass-derived polymer, but
              is currently synthesized by a two-step process: fermentative
              production of lactic acid followed by chemical polymerization.
              Here we report production of PLA homopolymer and its copolymer,
              poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate), P(3HB-co-LA), by direct
              fermentation of metabolically engineered Escherichia coli. As
              shown in an accompanying paper, introduction of the heterologous
              metabolic pathways involving engineered propionate
              CoA-transferase and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase for the
              efficient generation of lactyl-CoA and incorporation of
              lactyl-CoA into the polymer, respectively, allowed synthesis of
              PLA and P(3HB-co-LA) in E. coli, but at relatively low
              efficiency. In this study, the metabolic pathways of E. coli were
              further engineered by knocking out the ackA, ppc, and adhE genes
              and by replacing the promoters of the ldhA and acs genes with the
              trc promoter based on in silico genome-scale metabolic flux
              analysis in addition to rational approach. Using this engineered
              strain, PLA homopolymer could be produced up to 11 wt\% from
              glucose. Also, P(3HB-co-LA) copolymers containing 55-86 mol\%
              lactate could be produced up to 56 wt\% from glucose and 3HB.
              P(3HB-co-LA) copolymers containing up to 70 mol\% lactate could
              be produced to 46 wt\% from glucose alone by introducing the
              Cupriavidus necator beta-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA
              reductase genes. Thus, the strategy of combined metabolic
              engineering and enzyme engineering allowed efficient bio-based
              one-step production of PLA and its copolymers. This strategy
              should be generally useful for developing other engineered
              organisms capable of producing various unnatural polymers by
              direct fermentation from renewable resources.",

  abstract  = "Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the promising biodegradable
               polymers, which has been produced in a rather complicated
               two-step process by first producing lactic acid by fermentation
               followed by ring opening polymerization of lactide, a cyclic
               dimer of lactic acid. Recently, we reported the production of
               PLA and its copolymers by direct fermentation of metabolically
               engineered Escherichia coli equipped with the evolved propionate
               CoA-transferase and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase using
               glucose as a carbon source. When employing these initially
               constructed E. coli strains, however, it was necessary to use an
               inducer for the expression of the engineered genes and to feed
               succinate for proper cell growth. Here we report further
               metabolic engineering of E. coli strain to overcome these
               problems for more efficient production of PLA and its
               copolymers. This allowed efficient production of PLA and its
               copolymers without adding inducer and succinate. The finally
               constructed recombinant E. coli JLXF5 strain was able to produce

              and productivity. Here, we have constructed an E. coli strain to
              produce high yield of ethanol from hexose and pentose sugars by
              modulating the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetate
              kinase and by deleting pathways for competing co-products.
              RESULTS: The availability of reducing equivalence in E. coli was
              increased by inducing the expression of the pyruvate
              dehydrogenase (PDH) operon under anaerobic condition after
              replacement of its promoter with the promoters of ldhA, frdA,
              pflB, adhE and gapA. The SSY05 strain, where PDH operon was
              expressed under gapA promoter, demonstrated highest PDH activity
              and maximum improvement in ethanol yield. Deletion of genes
              responsible for competing products, such as lactate (ldhA),
              succinate (frdA), acetate (ack) and formate (pflB), led to
              significant reduction in growth rate under anaerobic condition.
              Modulation of acetate kinase expression in SSY09 strain regained
              cell growth rate and ethanol was produced at the maximum rate of
              12 mmol/l/h from glucose. The resultant SSY09(pZSack) strain
              efficiently fermented xylose under microaerobic condition and
              produced 25 g/l ethanol at the maximum rate of 6.84 mmol/l/h with
              97\% of the theoretical yield. More importantly, fermentation of
              mixture of glucose and xylose was achieved by SSY09(pZSack)
              strain under microaerobic condition and ethanol was produced at
              the maximum rate of 0.7 g/l/h (15 mmol/l/h), respectively, with
              greater than 85\% of theoretical yield. CONCLUSIONS: The E. coli
              strain SSY09(pZSack) constructed via endogenous pathway
              engineering fermented glucose and xylose to ethanol with high
              yield and productivity. This strain lacking any foreign gene for
              ethanol fermentation is likely to be genetically more stable and
              therefore should be tested further for the fermentation of
              lignocellulosic hydrolysate at higher scale.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Due to its abundance and low-price, glycerol has
               become an attractive carbon source for the industrial production
               of value-added fuels and chemicals. This work reports the
               engineering of E. coli for the efficient conversion of glycerol
               into L-lactic acid (L-lactate). RESULTS: Escherichia coli
               strains have previously been metabolically engineered for the
               microaerobic production of D-lactic acid from glycerol in
               defined media by disrupting genes that minimize the synthesis of
               succinate, acetate, and ethanol, and also overexpressing the
               respiratory route of glycerol dissimilation (GlpK/GlpD). Here,
               further rounds of rationale design were performed on these
               strains for the homofermentative production of L-lactate, not
               normally produced in E. coli. Specifically, L-lactate production
               was enabled by: 1), replacing the native D-lactate specific
               dehydrogenase with Streptococcus bovis L-lactate dehydrogenase
               (L-LDH), 2) blocking the methylglyoxal bypass pathways to avoid
               the synthesis of a racemic mixture of D- and L-lactate and
               prevent the accumulation of toxic intermediate, methylglyoxal,
               and 3) the native aerobic L-lactate dehydrogenase was blocked to
               prevent the undesired utilization of L-lactate. The engineered
               strain produced 50 g/L of L-lactate from 56 g/L of crude
               glycerol at a yield 93\% of the theoretical maximum and with
               high optical (99.9\%) and chemical (97\%) purity. CONCLUSIONS:
               This study demonstrates the efficient conversion of glycerol to
               L-lactate, a microbial process that had not been reported in the
               literature prior to our work. The engineered biocatalysts
               produced L-lactate from crude glycerol in defined minimal salts
               medium at high chemical and optical purity.",

              succinate production by combining the deletion of genes that
              disrupt fermentation pathways for alternative products
              (ldhA::FRT, adhE::FRT, ackA::FRT, focA-pflB::FRT, mgsA, poxB)
              with growth-based selection for increased ATP production. The
              resulting strain, KJ073, produced 1.2 mol of succinate per mol
              glucose in mineral salts medium with acetate, malate, and
              pyruvate as significant co-products. KJ073 has been further
              improved by removing residual recombinase sites (FRT sites) from
              the chromosomal regions of gene deletion to create a strain
              devoid of foreign DNA, strain KJ091(DeltaldhA DeltaadhE DeltaackA
              DeltafocA-pflB DeltamgsA DeltapoxB). KJ091 was further engineered

              2-ketobutyrate formate-lyase (tdcE; pyruvate formate-lyase

              production of D-lactic acid from glycerol",
  author   = "Mazumdar, Suman and Clomburg, James M and Gonzalez, Ramon",
  abstract = "Given its availability and low price, glycerol has become an
              ideal feedstock for the production of fuels and chemicals. We
              recently reported the pathways mediating the metabolism of
              glycerol in Escherichia coli under anaerobic and microaerobic
              conditions. In this work, we engineer E. coli for the efficient
              conversion of glycerol to d-lactic acid (d-lactate), a negligible
              product of glycerol metabolism in wild-type strains. A
              homofermentative route for d-lactate production was engineered by
              overexpressing pathways involved in the conversion of glycerol to
              this product and blocking those leading to the synthesis of
              competing by-products. The former included the overexpression of
              the enzymes involved in the conversion of glycerol to glycolytic
              intermediates (GlpK-GlpD and GldA-DHAK pathways) and the
              synthesis of d-lactate from pyruvate (d-lactate dehydrogenase).
              On the other hand, the synthesis of succinate, acetate, and
              ethanol was minimized through two strategies: (i) inactivation of
              pyruvate-formate lyase (DeltapflB) and fumarate reductase
              (DeltafrdA) (strain LA01) and (ii) inactivation of fumarate
              reductase (DeltafrdA), phosphate acetyltransferase (Deltapta),
              and alcohol/acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (DeltaadhE) (strain LA02).
              A mutation that blocked the aerobic d-lactate dehydrogenase
              (Deltadld) also was introduced in both LA01 and LA02 to prevent
              the utilization of d-lactate. The most efficient strain
              (LA02Deltadld, with GlpK-GlpD overexpressed) produced 32 g/liter
              of d-lactate from 40 g/liter of glycerol at a yield of 85\% of
              the theoretical maximum and with a chiral purity higher than
              99.9\%. This strain exhibited maximum volumetric and specific
              productivities for d-lactate production of 1.5 g/liter/h and 1.25
              g/g cell mass/h, respectively. The engineered homolactic route
              generates 1 to 2 mol of ATP per mol of d-lactate and is redox
              balanced, thus representing a viable metabolic pathway.",

  abstract = "The fermentative metabolism of Escherichia coli was reengineered
              to efficiently convert glycerol to succinate under anaerobic
              conditions without the use of foreign genes. Formate and ethanol
              were the dominant fermentation products from glycerol in
              wild-type Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, followed by succinate and
              acetate. Inactivation of pyruvate formate-lyase (pflB) in the
              wild-type strain eliminated the production of formate and ethanol
              and reduced the production of acetate. However, this deletion
              slowed growth and decreased cell yields due to either
              insufficient energy production or insufficient levels of electron
              acceptors. Reversing the direction of the gluconeogenic
              phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction offered an approach to
              solve both problems, conserving energy as an additional ATP and
              increasing the pool of electron acceptors (fumarate and malate).
              Recruiting this enzyme through a promoter mutation (pck*) to
              increase expression also increased the rate of growth, cell
              yield, and succinate production. Presumably, the high NADH/NAD(+)
              ratio served to establish the direction of carbon flow.
              Additional mutations were also beneficial. Glycerol dehydrogenase
              and the phosphotransferase-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase are
              regarded as the primary route for glycerol metabolism under
              anaerobic conditions. However, this is not true for succinate
              production by engineered strains. Deletion of the ptsI gene or
              any other gene essential for the phosphotranferase system was
              found to increase succinate yield. Deletion of pflB in this
              background provided a further increase in the succinate yield.
              Together, these three core mutations (pck*, ptsI, and pflB)
              effectively redirected carbon flow from glycerol to succinate at
              80\% of the maximum theoretical yield during anaerobic
              fermentation in mineral salts medium.",

  title    = "L-malate production by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli",
  author   = "Zhang, X and Wang, X and Shanmugam, K T and Ingram, L O",
  abstract = "Escherichia coli strains (KJ060 and KJ073) that were previously
              developed for succinate production have now been modified for
              malate production. Many unexpected changes were observed during
              this investigation. The initial strategy of deleting fumarase
              isoenzymes was ineffective, and succinate continued to
              accumulate. Surprisingly, a mutation in fumarate reductase alone
              was sufficient to redirect carbon flow into malate even in the
              presence of fumarase. Further deletions were needed to inactivate
              malic enzymes (typically gluconeogenic) and prevent conversion to
              pyruvate. However, deletion of these genes (sfcA and maeB)
              resulted in the unexpected accumulation of D-lactate despite the
              prior deletion of mgsA and ldhA and the absence of apparent
              lactate dehydrogenase activity. Although the metabolic source of
              this D-lactate was not identified, lactate accumulation was
              increased by supplementation with pyruvate and decreased by the
              deletion of either pyruvate kinase gene (pykA or pykF) to reduce
              the supply of pyruvate. Many of the gene deletions adversely
              affected growth and cell yield in minimal medium under anaerobic
              conditions, and volumetric rates of malate production remained
              low. The final strain (XZ658) produced 163 mM malate, with a
              yield of 1.0 mol (mol glucose(-1)), half of the theoretical
              maximum. Using a two-stage process (aerobic cell growth and
              anaerobic malate production), this engineered strain produced 253
              mM malate (34 g liter(-1)) within 72 h, with a higher yield (1.42
              mol mol(-1)) and productivity (0.47 g liter(-1) h(-1)). This
              malate yield and productivity are equal to or better than those
              of other known biocatalysts.",

  abstract = "We report the homofermentative production of lactate in
              Escherichia coli strains containing mutations in the aceEF, pfl,
              poxB, and pps genes, which encode the pyruvate dehydrogenase
              complex, pyruvate formate lyase, pyruvate oxidase, and
              phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, respectively. The process uses a
              defined medium and two distinct fermentation phases: aerobic
              growth to an optical density of about 30, followed by nongrowth,
              anaerobic production. Strain YYC202 (aceEF pfl poxB pps)
              generated 90 g/liter lactate in 16 h during the anaerobic phase
              (with a yield of 0.95 g/g and a productivity of 5.6 g/liter . h).
              Ca(OH)(2) was found to be superior to NaOH for pH control, and
              interestingly, significant succinate also accumulated (over 7
              g/liter) despite the use of N(2) for maintaining anaerobic
              conditions. Strain ALS961 (YYC202 ppc) prevented succinate
              accumulation, but growth was very poor. Strain ALS974 (YYC202
              frdABCD) reduced succinate formation by 70\% to less than 3
              g/liter. (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance analysis using
              uniformly labeled acetate demonstrated that succinate formation
              by ALS974 was biochemically derived from acetate in the medium.
              The absence of uniformly labeled succinate, however, demonstrated
              that glyoxylate did not reenter the tricarboxylic acid cycle via
              oxaloacetate. By minimizing the residual acetate at the time that
              the production phase commenced, the process with ALS974 achieved
              138 g/liter lactate (1.55 M, 97\% of the carbon products), with a
              yield of 0.99 g/g and a productivity of 6.3 g/liter . h during
              the anaerobic phase.",

              Escherichia coli for the absolute aerobic production of succinate",
  author   = "Lin, Henry and Bennett, George N and San, Ka-Yiu",
  abstract = "Most reported efforts to enhance production of the industrially
              valuable specialty chemical succinate have been done under
              anaerobic conditions, where E. coli undergoes mixed-acid
              fermentation. These efforts have often been hampered by the
              limitations of NADH availability, poor cell growth, and slow
              production. An aerobic succinate production system was
              strategically designed that allows E. coli to produce and
              accumulate succinate efficiently and substantially as a product
              under absolute aerobic conditions. Mutations in the tricarboxylic
              acid cycle (sdhAB, icd, iclR) and acetate pathways (poxB,
              ackA-pta) of E. coli were created to construct the glyoxylate
              cycle for aerobic succinate production. Experiments in flask
              studies showed that 14.28 mM of succinate could be produced
              aerobically with a yield of 0.344 mole/mole using 55 mM glucose.
              In aerobic batch reactor studies, succinate production rate was
              faster, reaching 0.5 mole/mole in 24 h with a concentration of
              22.12 mM; further cultivation showed that succinate production
              reached 43 mM with a yield of 0.7. There was also substantial
              pyruvate and TCA cycle C(6) intermediate accumulation in the
              mutant. The results suggest that more metabolic engineering
              improvements can be made to this system to make aerobic succinate
              production more efficient. Nevertheless, this aerobic succinate
              production system provides the first platform for enhancing
              succinate production aerobically in E. coli based on the creation
              of a new aerobic central metabolic network.",

              the main acetyl-CoA production pathway. In contrast to E. coli B
              and W3110 pflB derivatives, we found that the MG1655 pflB
              derivative is able to grow in mineral media with glucose as the
              sole carbon source under fermentative conditions. The glycolytic
              flux was 2.8-fold higher in CL3 when compared to the wild-type
              strain, and lactate yield on glucose was 95\%. Although a low
              cell mass formed under fermentative conditions with this strain
              (1.2 g/L), the volumetric productivity of CL3 was 1.31 g/L h. In
              comparison with the parental strain, CL3 has a 22\% lower ATP/ADP
              ratio. In contrast to wild-type E. coli, the ATP yield from
              glucose to lactate is 2 ATP/glucose, so CL3 has to improve its
              glycolytic flux in order to fulfill its ATP needs in order to
              grow. The aceF deletion in strains MG1655 and CL3 indicates that
              the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is functional under
              glucose-fermentative conditions. These results suggest that the
              pyruvate to acetyl-CoA flux in CL3 is dependent on PDH activity
              and that the decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio causes an increase in
              the flux of glucose to lactate.",

  abstract  = "Redox and energy balance plays a key role in determining
               microbial fitness. Efforts to redirect bacterial metabolism
               often involve overexpression and deletion of genes surrounding
               key central metabolites, such as pyruvate and acetyl-coA. In the
               case of metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for succinate
               production, efforts have mainly focused on the manipulation of
               key pyruvate metabolizing enzymes. E. coli AFP111 strain lacking
               ldhA, pflB and ptsG encoded activities accumulates acetate and
               ethanol as well as shows poor anaerobic growth on rich and
               minimal media. To address these issues, we first deleted genes
               (adhE, ackA-pta) involved in byproduct formation downstream of
               acetyl-CoA followed by the deletion of iclR and pdhR to activate
               the glyoxylate pathway. Based on data from these studies, we
               hypothesized that the succinate productivity was limited by the
               insufficient ATP generation. Genome-scale thermodynamics-based
               flux balance analysis indicated that overexpression of
               ATP-forming PEPCK from Actinobacillus succinogenes in an ldhA,
               pflB and ptsG triple mutant strain could result in an increase
               in biomass and succinate flux. Testing of this prediction
               confirmed that PEPCK overexpression resulted in a 60\% increase
               in biomass and succinate formation in the ldhA, pflB, ptsG

              microaerobic condition, the mutants reduced approximately 90\%
              acetate excretion after the deletion of genes ackA-pta and poxB.
              Production of lactate, ethanol, and formate was also
              significantly reduced after the deletion of genes ldhA, adhE, and
              pflB, respectively. The accumulation of biomass and
              poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) were significantly enhanced after
              deleting the mixed acid fermentation. E. coli mutant BWapld with
              deletions of ackA-pta, poxB, ldhA, and adhE produced twice the
              cell dry weight (CDW) and 3.5 times of PHB compared with its

              twice CDW and three times of PHB content in comparison to the
              wild-type during 48 h static cultivation. Production of
              poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [P(3HB-co-3HV)] was

              The remaining pathways, identified by elementary mode analysis,
              consist of four pathways with non-growth-associated conversion of

              yield. We showed that the ethanol yields of strains with

  title     = "Synergy as design principle for metabolic engineering of
               1-propanol production in Escherichia coli",
  author    = "Shen, Claire R and Liao, James C",
  abstract  = "Synthesis of a desired product can often be achieved via more
               than one metabolic pathway. Whether naturally evolved or
               synthetically engineered, these pathways often exhibit specific
               properties that are suitable for production under distinct
               conditions and host organisms. Synergy between pathways arises
               when the underlying pathway characteristics, such as reducing
               equivalent demand, ATP requirement, intermediate utilization,
               and cofactor preferences, are complementary to each other.
               Utilization of such pathways in combination leads to an
               increased metabolite productivity and/or yield compared to using
               each pathway alone. This work illustrates the principle of
               synergy between two different pathways for 1-propanol production
               in Escherichia coli. A model-guided design based on maximum
               theoretical yield calculations identified synergy of the native
               threonine pathway and the heterologous citramalate pathway in
               terms of production yield across all flux ratios between the two
               pathways. Characterization of the individual pathways by host
               gene deletions demonstrates their distinct metabolic
               characteristics: the necessity of TCA cycle for threonine
               pathway and the independence of TCA cycle for the citramalate
               pathway. The two pathways are also complementary in driving
               force demands. Production experiments verified the synergistic
               effects predicted by the yield model, in which the platform with
               dual pathway for 2-ketobutyrate synthesis achieved higher yield
               (0.15g/g of glucose) and productivity (0.12g/L/h) of 1-propanol
               than individual ones alone: the threonine pathway (0.09g/g;
               0.04g/L/h) or the citramalate pathway (0.11g/g; 0.04g/L/h).
               Thus, incorporation of synergy into the design principle of
               metabolic engineering may improve the production yield and rate
               of the desired compound.",

              NADH; pyruvate [pyruvate dehydrogenase] => acetyl-CoA + NADH; 2
              acetyl-CoA [butanol pathway enzymes] + 4 NADH => butanol; summary
              stoichiometry: glucose => butanol). Initially, the native
              fermentation pathways were eliminated from E. coli B by deleting
              the genes encoding for lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), acetate
              kinase (ackA), fumarate reductase (frdABCD), pyruvate formate
              lyase (pflB), and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE), and the pyruvate
              dehydrogenase complex (aceEF-lpd) was anaerobically expressed
              through promoter replacement. The resulting strain, E. coli EG03
              ($\Delta$frdABCD $\Delta$ldhA $\Delta$ackA $\Delta$pflB $\Delta$
              adhE $\Delta$pdhR ::pflBp6-aceEF-lpd $\Delta$mgsA), could

              through glycolysis and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
              However, EG03 lost its ability for anaerobic growth due to the
              lack of NADH oxidation pathways. When the butanol pathway genes
              that encode for acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (thiL),
              3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (hbd), crotonase (crt),
              butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (bcd, etfA, etfB), and butyraldehyde

              balanced NADH oxidation pathway was established for homobutanol
              fermentation (glucose => 4 NADH + 2 acetyl-CoA => butanol). This

              afflicted by both low titer and low selectivity (defined as the
              butyrate/acetate (B/A) ratio). To address this issue, a strategy
              for metabolic engineering of E. coli was implemented including
              (1) elimination of all major NADH-dependent reactions in the
              fermentation metabolism, (2) reconstruction of a heterologous
              pathway leading to butyryl-CoA, (3) recruitment of endogenous
              atoDA for conversion of butyryl-CoA to butyrate with acetate as a
              CoA acceptor, and (4) removal of the acetate-synthesis pathway.
              Grown on glucose (20 g/L) plus acetate (8 g/L), the engineered
              strain consumed almost all glucose and acetate and produced 10
              g/L butyrate as a predominant product within 48 h. It leads to
              high butyrate selectivity with the B/A ratio reaching 143. The
              result shows that our proposed approach may open a new avenue in

  abstract = "Methyl ketones are a group of highly reduced platform chemicals
              with widespread applications in the fragrance, flavor and
              pharmacological industries. Current methods for the industrial
              production of methyl ketones include oxidation of hydrocarbons,
              but recent advances in the characterization of methyl ketone
              synthases from wild tomato have sparked interest towards the
              development of microbial platforms for the industrial production
              of methyl ketones. A functional methyl ketone biosynthetic
              pathway was constructed in Escherichia coli by over-expressing
              two genes from Solanum habrochaites: shmks2, encoding a
              3-ketoacyl-ACP thioesterase, and shmks1, encoding a
              beta-decarboxylase. These enzymes enabled methyl ketone synthesis
              from 3-ketoacyl-ACP, an intermediate in the fatty acid
              biosynthetic cycle. The production of 2-nonanone, 2-undecanone,
              and 2-tridecanone by MG1655 pTH-shmks2-shmks1 was initially
              detected by nuclear magnetic resonance and gas
              chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses at levels close to 6
              mg/L. The deletion of major fermentative pathways leading to
              ethanol (adhE), lactate (ldhA), and acetate (pta, poxB)
              production allowed for the carbon flux to be redirected towards
              methyl ketone production, doubling total methyl ketone
              concentration. Variations in methyl ketone production observed
              under different working volumes in flask experiments led to a
              more detailed analysis of the effects of oxygen availability on
              methyl ketone concentration in order to determine optimal levels
              of oxygen. The methyl ketone concentration achieved with MG1655
              ∆adhE ∆ldhA ∆poxB ∆pta pTrcHis2A-shmks2-shmks1, the best
              performer strain in this study, was approximately 500 mg/L, the
              highest reported for an engineered microorganism. Through the
              establishment of optimal operating conditions and by executing
              rational metabolic engineering strategies, we were able to
              increase methyl ketone concentrations by almost 75-fold from the

  abstract = "Glycerol is an attractive carbon source for biofuel production
              since it is cheap and abundant due to the increasing demand for
              renewable and clean energy sources, which includes production of
              biodiesel. This research aims to enhance hydrogen production by
              Escherichia coli from glycerol by manipulating its metabolic
              pathways via targeted deletions. Since our past strain, which had
              been engineered for producing hydrogen from glucose, was not
              suitable for producing hydrogen from glycerol, we rescreened 14
              genes related to hydrogen production and glycerol metabolism. We
              found that 10 single knockouts are beneficial for enhanced
              hydrogen production from glycerol, namely, frdC (encoding for
              furmarate reductase), ldhA (lactate dehydrogenase), fdnG (formate
              dehydrogenase), ppc (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase), narG
              (nitrate reductase), focA (formate transporter), hyaB (the large
              subunit of hydrogenase 1), aceE (pyruvate dehydrogenase), mgsA
              (methylglyoxal synthase), and hycA (a regulator of the
              transcriptional regulator FhlA). On that basis, we created
              multiple knockout strains via successive P1 transductions.
              Simultaneous knockouts of frdC, ldhA, fdnG, ppc, narG, mgsA, and
              hycA created the best strain that produced 5-fold higher hydrogen
              and had a 5-fold higher hydrogen yield than the parent strain.
              The engineered strain also reached the theoretical maximum yield
              of 1 mol H2/mol glycerol after 48 h. Under low partial pressure
              fermentation, the strain grew over 2-fold faster, indicating
              faster utilization of glycerol and production of hydrogen. By
              combining metabolic engineering and low partial pressure
              fermentation, hydrogen production from glycerol was enhanced

  abstract = "An adhE, ldhA double mutant Escherichia coli strain, SBS110MG,
              has been constructed to produce succinic acid in the presence of
              heterologous pyruvate carboxylase (PYC). The strategic design
              aims at diverting maximum quantities of NADH for succinate
              synthesis by inactivation of NADH competing pathways to increase
              succinate yield and productivity. Additionally an operational PFL
              enzyme allows formation of acetyl-CoA for biosynthesis and
              formate as a potential source of reducing equivalents.
              Furthermore, PYC diverts pyruvate toward OAA to favor succinate
              generation. SBS110MG harboring plasmid pHL413, which encodes the
              heterologous pyruvate carboxylase from Lactococcus lactis,
              produced 15.6 g/L (132 mM) of succinate from 18.7 g/L (104 mM) of
              glucose after 24 h of culture in an atmosphere of CO(2) yielding
              1.3 mol of succinate per mole of glucose. This molar yield
              exceeded the maximum theoretical yield of succinate that can be
              achieved from glucose (1 mol/mol) under anaerobic conditions in
              terms of NADH balance. The current work further explores the
              importance of the presence of formate as a source of reducing
              equivalents in SBS110MG(pHL413). Inactivation of the native
              formate dehydrogenase pathway (FDH) in this strain significantly
              reduced succinate yield, suggesting that reducing power was lost
              in the form of formate. Additionally we investigated the effect
              of ptsG inactivation in SBS110MG(pHL413) to evaluate the
              possibility of a further increase in succinate yield. Elimination
              of the ptsG system increased the succinate yield to 1.4 mol/mol
              at the expense of a reduction in glucose consumption of 33\%. In
              the presence of PYC and an efficient conversion of glucose to
              products, the ptsG mutation is not indispensable since PEP
              converted to pyruvate as a result of glucose phosphorylation by
              the glucose specific PTS permease EIICB(glu) can be rediverted

              multiple, stable mutations into a single bacterium to direct the
              metabolic flux toward hydrogen production. E. coli cells convert
              glucose to various organic acids (such as succinate, pyruvate,
              lactate, formate, and acetate) to synthesize energy and hydrogen
              from formate by the formate hydrogen-lyase (FHL) system that
              consists of hydrogenase 3 and formate dehydrogenase-H. We altered
              the regulation of FHL by inactivating the repressor encoded by
              hycA and by overexpressing the activator encoded by fhlA, removed
              hydrogen uptake activity by deleting hyaB (hydrogenase 1) and
              hybC (hydrogenase 2), redirected glucose metabolism to formate by
              using the fdnG, fdoG, narG, focA, focB, poxB, and aceE mutations,
              and inactivated the succinate and lactate synthesis pathways by

               here we consider converting glycerol to hydrogen using the
               formate hydrogen lyase system of Escherichia coli which converts
               pyruvate to hydrogen. Starting with E. coli BW25113 frdC that
               lacks fumarate reductase (this mutation reduces repression of
               hydrogen synthesis during glycerol fermentation) and by using
               both adaptive evolution and chemical mutagenesis combined with a
               selection method based on increased growth on glycerol, we
               obtained an improved strain, HW2, that produces 20-fold more
               hydrogen in glycerol medium (0.68 ?? 0.16 mmol/L/h). HW2 also
               grows 5-fold faster (0.25 ?? 0.01/h) than BW25113 frdC on
               glycerol, so it achieves a reasonable anaerobic growth rate.
               Corroborating the increase in hydrogen production, glycerol
               dehydrogenase activity in HW2 increased 4-fold compared to
               BW25113 frdC. In addition, a whole-transcriptome study revealed
               that several pathways that would decrease hydrogen yields were
               repressed in HW2 (fbp, focA, and gatYZ) while a beneficial
               pathway which encodes enolase was induced. Ethanol production
               was also increased 5-fold in the evolved HW2 strain. ?? 2009

  abstract  = "Glycerol has become an ideal feedstock for the microbial
               production of bio-based chemicals due to its abundance, low
               cost, and high degree of reduction. We have previously reported
               the pathways and mechanisms for the utilization of glycerol by
               Escherichia coli in minimal salts medium under microaerobic
               conditions. Here we capitalize on such results to engineer E.
               coli for the production of value-added succinate from glycerol.
               Through metabolic engineering of E. coli metabolism, succinate
               production was greatly elevated by (1) blocking pathways for the
               synthesis of competing by-products lactate, ethanol, and acetate
               and (2) expressing Lactococcus lactis pyruvate carboxylase to
               drive the generation of succinate from the pyruvate node (as
               opposed to that of phosphoenolpyruvate). As such, these
               metabolic engineering strategies coupled cell growth to
               succinate production because the synthesis of succinate remained
               as the primary route of NAD+ regeneration. This feature enabled
               the operation of the succinate pathway in the absence of
               selective pressure (e.g. antibiotics). Our biocatalysts
               demonstrated a maximum specific productivity of ~400. mg

  author   = "Yazdani, Syed Shams and Gonzalez, Ramon",
  abstract = "Given its availability, low prices, and high degree of reduction,
              glycerol has become an ideal feedstock for producing reduced
              compounds via anaerobic fermentation. We recently identified
              environmental conditions enabling the fermentative metabolism of
              glycerol in E. coli, along with the pathways and mechanisms
              mediating this metabolic process. In this work, we used the
              knowledge base created in previous studies to engineer E. coli
              for the efficient conversion of crude glycerol to ethanol. Our
              strategy capitalized on the high degree of reduction of carbon in
              glycerol, thus enabling the production of not only ethanol but
              also co-products hydrogen and formate. Two strains were created
              for the co-production of ethanol-hydrogen and ethanol-formate:
              SY03 and SY04, respectively. High ethanol yields were achieved in
              both strains by minimizing the synthesis of by-products succinate
              and acetate through mutations that inactivated fumarate reductase
              (??frdA) and phosphate acetyltransferase (??pta), respectively.
              Strain SY04, which produced ethanol-formate, also contained a
              mutation that inactivated formate-hydrogen lyase (??fdhF), thus
              preventing the conversion of formate to CO2 and H2. High rates of
              glycerol utilization and product synthesis were achieved by
              simultaneous overexpression of glycerol dehydrogenase (gldA) and
              dihydroxyacetone kinase (dhaKLM), which are the enzymes
              responsible for the conversion of glycerol to glycolytic
              intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The resulting strains,
              SY03 (pZSKLMgldA) and SY04 (pZSKLMgldA), produced
              ethanol-hydrogen and ethanol-formate from unrefined glycerol at
              yields exceeding 95\% of the theoretical maximum and specific
              rates in the order of 15-30 mmol/gcell/h. These yields and
              productivities are superior to those reported for the conversion
              of glycerol to ethanol-H2 or ethanol-formate by other organisms
              and equivalent to those achieved in the production of ethanol
